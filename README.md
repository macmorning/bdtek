Quick test of backend-less comics collection single page app using
* Firebase for storage and Google authentification
* AWS to search books to import with their EAN
* Yahoo Query Language as a proxy to work around CORS

Only a test though, because you can't use AWS client-side without compromising your private key.

To try it, create your own conf.js based on the conf_template.js.
